This is simply a small console program that will prompt you a specified number of times to type a sentence correctly.
It judges your _speed_, taking (_words_ / _time_), and your _accuracy_, feeding the _prompt_ and your _input_ into the Demerau-Levenstein algorithm.
This finds the minimum number of changes to make to change the one into the other.

Your results are then factored in alongside the calculated _difficulty_ of the prompt to give a _score_.

These results are then totaled at the end and averages are computed.
