Call me by your name
The quick lazy dog browned the fox
For time in our years, there was
Caesar picked a zebra, opened
Carl Linderes's hugs queued in line
The sun sets behind distant mountains
Rainbows emerge after the storm passes
Birds chirp happily in the morning light
Stars twinkle in the vast night sky
Dogs play fetch in the grassy park
Books carry stories from ages long past
Coffee brews, filling the air with aroma
Hats shield heads from the scorching sun
Bikes race along winding mountain trails
Ocean waves crash against rocky cliffs
Fire crackles, warming cold winter nights
Clouds drift aimlessly in the endless sky
Kids giggle, running through fields of flowers
Trees sway gently in the autumn breeze
Music resonates, touching hearts with melodies
Phones ring incessantly in the bustling office
Snowflakes fall silently, covering the town
Winds whisper secrets through rustling leaves
Love grows stronger with each passing day
Time heals wounds, shaping our destinies
